# Design and Implementation Report: Kernel Module Integrity Monitor (KMIM)

## Executive Summary
This report documents the design and implementation of the enhanced Kernel Module Integrity Monitor (KMIM), a comprehensive security tool developed to enhance Linux system security through continuous kernel module integrity monitoring. The implementation focuses on providing a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for detecting unauthorized modifications to kernel modules, now featuring enhanced syscall monitoring, rich color-coded output, and comprehensive module analysis capabilities.
